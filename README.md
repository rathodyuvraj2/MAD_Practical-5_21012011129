**Ans:**

An Intent is a messaging object used to request an action from another app component in Android. It is mostly used to start an activity, send a broadcast receiver, start services, and send messages between two activities1.

There are two types of Intents in Android:

Implicit Intent: Using implicit Intent, components canâ€™t be specified. An action to be performed is declared by implicit intent. Then the Android operating system will filter out components that will respond to the action. For example, opening a webpage.
The user does not name a specific component but declares a general action to perform
ex:When you tap the share button in any app you can see the Gmail, Bluetooth, and other sharing app options.

Explicit Intent: Explicit Intent specifies the component. In such a case, intent provides the external class to be invoked. For example, moving from one activity to another within your app.
The user has a clear vision and knows exactly which activity can handle the requests
ex:Suppose you have two activities in your application: MainActivity and SecondActivity. You want to navigate from MainActivity to SecondActivity when a button is clicked.

Types of Intent Actions:

1. Browser Intent:
Action: Open browser for search specific things.
2. Call Intent:
Action: Initiate a phone call to John Smith's phone number.
3. Call Log Intent:
Action: Retrieve and display the user's call log entries for the specified time period (in this case, 
today).
4. Gallery Intent:
Action: Retrieve and display photos from the user's photo gallery that are tagged or identified as 
being from their vacation.
5. Camera Intent:
Action: Activate the device's camera and prompt the user to capture a picture of the sunset.
6. Alarm Intent:
Action: Schedule an alarm to trigger at 7:30 AM the next day.
